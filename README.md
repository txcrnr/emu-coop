# emu-coop

Contact t0xicrunner#4114 on Discord if you run into any issues or have feedback on the Z3M3 Randomizer co-op mode script.


This directory contains some Lua scripts that, when loaded by a compliant emulator such as snes9x-rr or FCEUX, can synchronize emulator state over the internet (allowing "cooperative" playthroughs of single-player games).

Each game you want to use this with requires a "mode" file in the modes/ directory. Currently included are modes for Link to the Past, the Link to the Past "Randomizer", Zelda 1 and Super Metroid. **WARNING: Modes are PROGRAMS, like a .exe file. Do not install a mode file unless it came from someone you know and trust.** 

This version of emu-coop comes pre-built with the Zelda 3: A Link to the Past + Metroid 3: Super Metroid (henceforth referred to as Z3M3) co-op randomizer.

To run, run coop.lua. To run with additional debug messages (more verbose errors, and visibility for every message sent) run debug.lua instead.

This version of emu-coop comes pre-built with the Zelda 3: A Link to the Past + Metroid 3: Super Metroid (henceforth referred to as Z3M3) co-op randomizer.  

When using the Z3M3 co-op mode, make sure that you are in-game and NOT on the title screen for Super Metroid before connecting.
